	<h1>Study program Bachelor of ICT</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
      Western society is based on well functioning but rapidly changing technological 
	  applications. However, mere specialisation is no longer enough modern technologists 
	  need to be capable of forming a global overview of the developments in their branch. 
	  Accordingly, graduates from the Faculty of Technology of University Drenthe are 
	  broadly educated technologists with an eye for innovation, management and social 
	  circumstances. The Faculty of Technology offers a four-year study program Bachelor 
	  of ICT.
	</p>
	<h2>Course characters</h2>
	<p>
      Work is done on a problem-oriented, project basis, often involving external research, 
	  and the practical training periods are completed at interesting positions in the 
	  relevant industries.
	</p>
	<h2>Internship</h2>
	<p>
      In the third and fourth year students have the opportunity to put the theory into 
	  practice. A company based traineeship of five months in the third year is part of 
	  the program and in the fourth year students work on a final graduation project for 
	  one semester. Both periods can be spent in the Netherlands or abroad.
